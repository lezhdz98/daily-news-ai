# ðŸ“° Daily News Browser AI Agent

The **Daily News Browser AI Agent** is a Streamlit-powered application that leverages the [`browser-use`](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) Python package to autonomously browse the web, gather real-time news, and generate concise summaries. The app highlights the top news of the day and allows you to download a full summary as a PDF for offline reading.

Using the `browser-use` package, the AI agent mimics human-like web behavior by autonomously clicking links, reading pages, and collecting relevant headlines each day. This makes it an efficient tool for anyone looking to stay updated with the latest news.
